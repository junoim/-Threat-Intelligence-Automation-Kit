# 🕵️‍♀️ Threat Intelligence Automation Kit

The **Threat Intelligence Automation Kit** is a Flask-based web app that simulates a dark web forum and helps identify potential cybercrime-related posts. It uses keyword-based detection, threat scoring, and digital evidence hashing to assist in passive cybercrime monitoring and reporting.

This tool is built to **simulate** how suspicious content might appear in online forums or marketplaces, and how an analyst or law enforcement agency might automate the detection and documentation of such threats.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Fake dark web forum simulation**
- ✍️ Users can **post messages** (simulated actors)
- 🧠 **Automated keyword detection** with confidence scoring
- 🔒 **SHA-256 hashing** of each post for tamper-proof records
- 🌐 Generates **fake IP addresses** and **user IDs**
- 📊 **Threat scoring** with configurable weights
- 📄 **Markdown to PDF export** of posts with scores
- 📈 Visual tools: **word cloud** and **timeline charts**
- 🧩 Easily update **rulesets (keywords and weights)** via JSON

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Database:** SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Other Tools/Libraries:**
  - `hashlib` for evidence hashing
  - `random`, `re`, `json` for simulation and logic
  - `matplotlib`, `wordcloud` for visualization
  - `pdfkit` / `markdown2` for PDF export

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threat-intel-kit.git
cd threat-intel-kit
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Running the App

1. **Run the Flask server**
```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Open your browser and visit:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- When a user **posts a message**, the system:
  1. Scans the text using a **customizable keyword ruleset** (in `keywords.json`)
  2. Assigns a **threat score** based on keyword weightings
  3. Computes a **SHA-256 hash** of the post for evidence preservation
  4. Simulates a **random IP address** and **user identity**
  5. Displays the threat level (Low, Medium, High)

- Posts and their scores can be:
  - **Exported as PDFs**
  - **Visualized as a word cloud**
  - **Plotted over time (timeline graph)**
